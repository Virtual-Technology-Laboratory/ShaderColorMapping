Shader Colormapping
===================

CubicYFcolormapShader_*.unitypackage contains a prefab of a Quadwith a
customized shader capable of reading single channel float32 geotiff datasets
and applying a colormap with monotonically increasing luminance. 

Using the Shader
---------------------
Internally the shader normalizes the float data to between 0 and 1 based on the
Min Value and Max Value fields specified in the inspector. The example depicts
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index maps with a range of -1 to 1 so these
values are specified as the Min and Max values respectively.

Shader and Material Details
---------------------------

To avoid tiling and other problems the slide image resources needs to:
   1. Be imported as "Advanced"
   2. Have wrap mode set to clamp
   3. Have generate mipmaps disabled
   
Procedurally Slide Changes
--------------------------

Slides can be procedurally changed by setting the "_MainTex" texture of the 
projector's material.
